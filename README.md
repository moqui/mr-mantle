Mantle Business Artifacts for [MR Moqui](https://github.com/moqui/mr-moqui), in one component named `mr-mantle`:

- **Universal Data Model** (`entity/`, the seed, install and demo data in `data/`), from the Java Moqui component
  [mantle-udm](https://github.com/moqui/mantle-udm).
- **Universal Service Library** (`service/`, its data and `test/` specs), from the Java Moqui component
  [mantle-usl](https://github.com/moqui/mantle-usl).

The two were ported in the forks `mr-mantle-udm` and `mr-mantle-usl` (Groovy to JavaScript, Spock flows to JavaScript
specs run by `moqui test`), then merged into this repository with the commit history of both. Other components depend on
it with `<depends-on name="mr-mantle"/>`; the renames from the Java names are in the MR Moqui
`docs/dev/Moqui-Java-Migration.md`.

```sh
./moq component-get mr-mantle
./moq test mr-mantle
./moq test mr-mantle --spec OrderToCashBasicFlow
```
